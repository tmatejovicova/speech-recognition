## Abstract
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of phone-based continuous speech recognition
systems based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in various settings. In thefirst part of the project
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are used to model the state output distributions and in the
second part Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in a DNN-HMM hybrid model. The TIMIT
Acoustic-Phonetic speech database is used for training to construct a speaker independent phone
recognition system.
